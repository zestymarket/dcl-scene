# Zesty Banner Decentraland Test Scene

This repository contains the most basic example of integrating the Zesty Banner smart item into a scene built with the Decentraland SDK.

## Try it out

**Install the CLI**

Download and install the Decentraland CLI by running the following command:

```bash
npm i -g decentraland
```

**Initialize a new scene**

Create a new project folder, then in your terminal type:

```bash
dcl init
```

This will allow you to quickly bootstrap a new Decentraland project. Choose "Scene" from the list of options, then use the arrow keys to move down to the "Paste a repository URL" option. Select this, then enter the URL of this repository to bootstrap the scene.

**Previewing the scene**

Open this folder on the command line, then run:

```
dcl start
```

Any dependencies are installed and then the CLI opens the scene in a new browser tab.

## Deploy to Decentraland

If you own any parcels of land in Decentraland, or have permissions to deploy to someone else's, you can publish this project.

1. Make sure the scene parcels in `scene.json` match those you own or have permissions on.
2. Run `dcl deploy` on the project folder
3. This will open a browser tab to confirm. Metamask will prompt you to sign.
   > Note: Make sure you are using the wallet that owns the parcels or has permissions.

### Deploy to a free server

If you don't own parcels in Decentraland or are not ready to publish your scene to the world, you can share your creations by uploading your scenes to a free hosting service.

See [Upload a preview](https://docs.decentraland.org/development-guide/deploy-to-now/) for instructions on how to do this.
